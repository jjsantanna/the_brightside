The weekend was wonderful. We've had an excellent experience in the shop to buy our fireplace. It is not yet 100% what I want but I will keep seaching and interacting with the sellers. Driving there and back was a chaos. Priscilla and Milena puking! At least Milena had fun =D She is so awesome. She gets bad then 1 minute after she is good. We have a lot to learn from her. At least she express all her frustration while we don't; I think. 

Another wonderful event was to run 10K under 1h. Thanks to Jonny! If I would have run alone I would have slow down. In the first km I was already feeling pain here and there. Next week wil be our 5k! "Faca na caveira!" lets see! Ahhh, we also ate a picanha but it was not everything that I always expect. The company of Bel, Jonny, and Theo was the most amazing thing that could have happened. I miss my wife but we will get better SOON. I see!

I love you! This week I will finish the white paper! I want! I also want to finish the scope of our service on Microsoft 365 assessment! and I will be there until my wife fall asleep. And I will smile in the morning with my daughter.
