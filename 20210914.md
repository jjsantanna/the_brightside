"For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him." Dear Jesus, do not condemn me but help me to be saved through you. Help me to be right and just. Help me to shine your love and mercifulness. I love you. Bless my kids, my wife, my mother and father, my sisters and my brother and all those that are around me. Could you please also bless the ones that don't like me, don't believe in me and don't want my happiness? I embrace these towards learning how to be a good disciple of yours.
