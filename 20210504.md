Dear God, today I give you EVERYTHING that you gave me. By being without anything, I ask you to fill my dirtyness with your glory. I'm yours my God. I give you my daughter, my wife, my son, my mother, my sister, my father, my history, the things that I bought, The man that I became. Please just stay with me and make me more saint. I want you. I want!
Jair
